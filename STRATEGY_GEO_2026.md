# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Strategy 2026

## Overview
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) focuses on optimizing content so that it is sourced and cited by AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews (SGE), and Claude. Traditional SEO optimizes for the top 10 blue links; GEO optimizes to become the answer itself.

## Core Philosophy
- **Answers Over Links:** Provide clear, conversational answers to real questions instead of just repeating keywords.
- **Factual Value & Human Voice:** AI prefers content written in a clear, human voice, packed with factual insights, real opinions, and zero fluff.
- **Omnipresence:** AI doesn't just read your website. It pulls from reviews (Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor), listicles ("Top 10..."), forums (Reddit, Quora), and local listings.

## Local GEO Action Plan for Quicksilver

### 1. Google Business Profile (GBP) & Local Authority
- **Consistency (NAP):** Name, Address, and Phone Number must be identical across the website, GBP, and all directories.
  - **Name:** Quicksilver Airport Shuttle
  - **Address:** MCI Airport Zone, Kansas City, MO 64153
  - **Phone:** (913) 262-0905
- **Updates:** Keep hours, services, and photos hyper-updated. AI scrapes this directly. Ensure Q&A section on GBP is filled with common questions.

### 2. Reviews & Sentiment
- **Volume & Recency:** Actively ask for reviews across Google, Yelp, and TrustPilot.
- **Sentiment & Responses:** Respond to all reviews. AI analyzes the sentiment of reviews to determine trust algorithms.

### 3. Listicle Mentions
- **Third-Party Listicles:** Get Quicksilver featured in articles like "Top 5 Airport Shuttles in Kansas City".
- **First-Party Comparisons:** Build our own "Top Options" or "Comparison" content that transparently compares competitors, including ourselves as the premier choice, allowing AI to scrape our curated facts. (e.g., `/airport-shuttle/compare`)

### 4. Structured Data & HTML
- **Rich Schema:** Use robust `LocalBusiness`, `FAQPage`, and `AggregateRating` schema across key pages so AI can parse facts instantly without guessing.
- **Lightweight HTML:** Minimize JavaScript where possible so AI bots can read the raw HTML effortlessly.

### 5. Content Structure
- Frame H2s and H3s as full natural questions (e.g., "How much does an airport shuttle to MCI cost in 2026?").
- Answer immediately below the heading in plain, conversational English before expanding on marketing details.
