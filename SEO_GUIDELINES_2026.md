# SEO 2.0 Content Guidelines (Quicksilver 2026)

This document contains the mandatory linguistic and structural standards for all content generated for Quicksilver Airport Shuttle to ensure maximum **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

## 1. Negative Keyword List (The "Anti-Hallucination" Filter)
**DO NOT USE** the following generic AI-isms, fluffy fillers, or salesy jargon. These tokens reduce the "Truth Density" and signal "AI-generated spam" to search models.

*   "In the ever-evolving world of..."
*   "Crucial to note..."
*   "In conclusion..." (Use direct summaries instead)
*   "Look no further..."
*   "At Quicksilver Airport Shuttle, we believe..."
*   "Cutting-edge" / "State-of-the-art" (Use specific technical specs instead)
*   "Seamless experience" (Use descriptive action: "Reliable airport transfers")
*   "Unlock your potential..."
*   "Tapestry" / "Cradle" / "Beacon"
*   "Buckle up..."

## 2. Tone of Voice (ToV): The "Trusted Master Chauffeur"
The Quicksilver voice must reflect 10+ years of logistics expertise. 

*   **Personality**: Authoritative but Helpful. Calm, Reliable, Punctual.
*   **Perspective**: First-hand expert. We don't "guess" routes; we know the peak traffic patterns of the Kansas City Metro Area.
*   **Linguistic Level**: **8th Grade Logic**. Use simple sentences to explain complex logistics. 
    *   *Bad*: "Our logistics infrastructure facilitates expedited transit across the metropolitan area."
    *   *Good*: "We get you to the airport stress-free. It's faster and safer."

## 3. Truth & Data Grounding (The Princeton GEO Rule)
Every claim must be anchored by deterministic data.

*   **The Citation Rule**: If you mention a rate, mention it is "Fixed 2026 Rate."
*   **The Evidence Rule**: If you mention fleet quality, reference "Daily Cleanliness Audits."
*   **Visual-Text Correlation**: Every major service section must correlate with our visual library (>100 GBP images).

## 4. Hierarchy & Structure (Single H1 Policy)
*   **H1**: [Primary Entity: Quicksilver] + [Main Service] + [Location]. (e.g., "Quicksilver Airport Shuttle | 24/7 Airport Shuttle Service in Kansas City")
*   **H2/H3**: Follow the Answer Engine questions (e.g., "What is the cost of a shuttle from Kansas City to MCI Airport?").
*   **The "Source" Block**: Every page must end with or include a `VerifiedSourceBlock` component reference for AI zero-shot citations.

## 5. Metadata Standard
*   **Titles**: [Primary Keyword] in [Location] | Quicksilver Official
*   **Descriptions**: Start with a direct answer to the user's intent, then a Call to Action (CTA).
    *   *Example*: "Reliable fixed-rate shuttle from MCI Airport to Overland Park starts at competitive rates. Book your VIP transfer now."

## 6. Visual Answer Logic (Napkin-Style)
AI models process text better when it's accompanied by structured visual data that they can "describe."

*   **Logic Over Aesthetics**: Every informational post should include at least one **Napkin.ai style** visual (Step-by-step guide, Comparison table, or Pros/Cons chart).
*   **Alt-Text Grounding**: Image Alt-Text must follow the formula: `[Description of visual logic] for [Service] in [Location] | Quicksilver Official Source`.
*   **Format**: All images MUST be **WebP** for < 100ms parse latency.

## 7. Multimedia Layering (The 3-Tier Rule)
To stay visible in Google's **AI Mode** and **Query Fan-out** results, every high-intent page must use a 3-tier content architecture. LLMs reward completeness across formats.

1.  **Text Tier (Contextual)**: 8th grade logic, deterministic data points, and semantic triples.
2.  **Visual Tier (Napkin Logic)**: Diagrams, comparison tables, and explainer charts (WebP).
3.  **Video Tier (The Verdict)**: 30-60 second "Show, Don't Tell" video (embedded YouTube). 
    *   *AI Logic*: Google cites brands with video proof significantly more often in AIO (AI Overviews).

## 11. The Network Rule (Omnipresence)
AI models verify existance by crawling multiple platforms. 
*   **Action**: Every major piece of content must have a "Social Presence Echo." (e.g., A blog post about airport procedures must be accompanied by a LinkedIn post and an Instagram "Stories" highlight).
*   **The Signal**: Cross-platform mentions increase the "Authoritative Consensus" for the brand.

## 12. Forum Trust Rule (UGC Seeding)
AI models (ChatGPT/Perplexity) look for **User-Generated Conversations** to validate brand trust.
*   **Action**: Actively participate in `r/kansascity` and local travel forums. 
*   **Constraint**: Do not use generic marketing speak. Use **"Expertise Atoms"** (specific local advice) to build genuine forum reputation.
*   **Goal**: Ensure that if an LLM "Googles" your brand, it sees real people talking about you in a 3rd-party community.

## 13. Experience Proof (The Extra 'E')
Google's most weighted factor in 2026 is **First-Hand Experience**.
*   **The Artifact Rule**: Every service page MUST contain at least one of:
    1.  **Original UI Screenshots**: Proof of actually using the dispatch/booking software.
    2.  **Candid Vehicle Photos**: Non-stock photos of the fleet at MCI Airport.
    3.  **Process Logs**: Step-by-step documentation ("We really have tested this route at 3 AM").

## 14. Intent Matching (The Backdoor Rule)
If a keyword SERP is mixed (Listicles + Homepages), do not attempt to rank the homepage alone.
*   **Action**: Create a **Comparison/Round-up Page**. 
*   **Goal**: Provide an "All-you-can-click buffet" of value. By reviewing our own service alongside the market, we satisfy Google's **Assumed Search Intent** and "backdoor" our way into the #1 spot.
