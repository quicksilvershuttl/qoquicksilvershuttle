# Local SEO Backlink & Digital PR Automation System (2026)
*Reference: The Best Local SEO Strategy in 2026 (Pillar 4: Backlinks & Authority)*

This document contains the exact ChatGPT (or Claude) Workflow and Prompts needed to automate the acquisition of local backlinks and PR brand mentions for Quicksilver Airport Shuttle.

## The Strategy
AI search models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) frequently cite domains that possess strong, authoritative backlink profiles and consensus mentions in local news. 
Instead of paying for expensive PR agencies, we can use AI to build "Subject Matter Expert" (SME) responses to journalist queries on platforms like HARO (Help a Reporter Out), Featured, or Qwoted.

## Phase 1: Build the "Chauffeur Expert" Knowledge Base
If you (the owner) do not have time to sit and answer questions, we will train a custom ChatGPT/Claude project to answer for you in your exact tone of voice.

1. **Interview the SME**: Have a 15-minute recorded conversation (using your phone's voice memo) with your most experienced driver or the owner. 
2. **Ask prompt questions**:
   - "What are the most dangerous stretches of highway in Kansas City right now?"
   - "How is the new MCI single terminal changing local transport?"
   - "What are your top 3 tips for a stress-free business trip to KC?"
3. **Transcribe**: Use an AI transcription tool (like Otter.ai or Mac whisper) to transcribe the audio.

## Phase 2: Create the AI Project / Custom GPT
Go to ChatGPT, create a new "Project" or "Custom GPT", and attach the transcribed knowledge.

### Setup Instructions (Paste this into ChatGPT's Custom Instructions):
```text
You are representing [Quicksilver Airport Shuttle Executive/Owner Name], the leading expert on executive transportation and airport shuttles in Kansas City, Missouri since 1982.

Your role is to respond to journalist inquiries from platforms like Featured or HARO.
You must adopt an authoritative, professional, yet locally-grounded Midwestern tone. 
Always prioritize referencing your deep local knowledge of Kansas City (e.g., MCI Airport, I-435 traffic, local stadiums, severe mid-western weather driving).

Constraints:
1. Keep responses under 250 words.
2. Directly answer the journalist's prompt in the first sentence.
3. Provide a unique, contrarian, or hyper-local insight that a generic AI cannot know.
4. Conclude with: "[Your Name], Owner at Quicksilver Airport Shuttle (goquicksilver.com)"
```

## Phase 3: The Daily Automation Prompt
Once your AI is loaded with local knowledge, log into your PR platform (Featured.com / HARO) daily. Find a relevant query (e.g., "Tips for corporate travel logistics" or "Best driving safety tips").

Take the query and paste it into your Custom GPT with this exact prompt:

### The Daily Prompt:
```text
I have a journalist query from [Publication Name/Reporter Name]. 

The query is: "[Paste the exact PR query here]"

Write a highly engaging, expert quote answering this query. Inject one specific piece of local Kansas City/MCI airport context from our uploaded knowledge base to prove we are real local experts. Ensure it is formatted for a journalist to copy-paste directly into an article.
```

## Phase 4: Local Association Automation (The "Sponsorship" Hack)
Beyond PR, the masterclass mentions that local sponsorships are the "best moves". This prompt helps you find them.

### Local Opportunity Finder Prompt:
```text
Act as a Local SEO Strategist executing a 2026 backlink campaign. 
List 10 highly reputable local organizations, charities, or youth sports leagues in the Kansas City metro area (Missouri/Kansas) that offer a backlink in exchange for a small local sponsorship or donation (under $500). Provide the organization name, what they do, and likely URL footprint.
```

**Implementation Goal**: Execute the PR strategy 3 times a week (takes 5 minutes). Secure 1 local sponsorship per month. This will build the massive localized domain authority required to dominate ChatGPT and Google AI Overview citations in the local market.
